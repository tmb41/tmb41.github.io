As part of graduating the Object Oriented Ruby section of the Flatiron School's Full-Stack Web Development program, we are to code a handful of final projects that demonstrate our ability to implement what we've learned. One of these final projects is to code a RubyGem that allows a user to use a CLI to scrape a web site and display information in an efficient manner.

***The requirements were***:

1. Package as a gem
2. Provide a CLI on gem installation
3. CLI must provide data from an external source, whether scraped or via a public API. Data provided must go at least a level deep, generally by showing the user a list of available data and then being able to drill into a specific item

***Background***:

With my financial background, I wanted to learn code to make my life easier. Financial experts look at financial data all day, pulling the data from various sources. One popular free resource is Yahoo! Finance. It's free, clean, and relatively easy to use -- if I wanted to see important metrics for Google, or Alphabet, I could go [here](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=goog&ql=1) and see the current price, previous price, volume, market cap, and other datapoints.

***Overview***:

For this project, I wanted to be able to grab this information for the most popular stocks with the type of one keystroke, rather than multiple clicks and a keyword search. Further, I wanted to be able to simply type a ticker and pull the information if it was an odd-ball stock request.
