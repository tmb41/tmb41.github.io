After coming from a technical background of Industrial Engineering, and going into Mergers & Acquisitions, I was somewhat surprised, and let down, at the processes and systems inside Investment Banks and the financial industry as a whole. How could it be that the sector so pivotal to the United States' economy largely lags behind technologically -- and even further, shuns innovation?

Industrial Engineering is a branch of engineering which deals with the optimization of complex processes or systems. Industrial engineers work to eliminate waste of time, money, man-hours, energy and other resources that do not generate value. While I learned a lot about valuation, deal processes, and transactions... it certainly seemed like there was a lot of waste in the industry. I began to see how I could do my job better if I knew code, and just how much more blue-sky there is from an opportunities standpoint through learning computer languages. For example:

1. **Repetitive Tasks**: Investment Banks are known for hiring the best and the brightest -- it's no wonder many are let down to find in the beginning much of what you'll be doing is merging and styling Excel Workbooks, throwing dots on a map to make a fancy slide, scheduling phone calls, or cleaning files for a dataroom. *I couldn't help but think this could be done better with software.* This inevitably leads to...
2. **Turnover & Quality Control**: All the while individuals are learning how to do this via brute force, the manager above them on the chain is quite frustrated, knowing as soon as the lowest rank finally learns, they'll be offered more money from an up-stream source that doesn't want to deal with this issue in their hires. This leads to an infinite loop of a terrible learning environment, as well as down-stream firms having horrible quality control. Work product you may receive one day wont necessarily be that of the next, or even between one group versus the other, as human capital is constantly entering or fleeing, with little retained within the firm. *I couldn't help but think this could be done better with software.* This in turn leads to...
3. **Technology Stifling**: All of this, in combination with the personality-types attracted to finance, leads to information shuttering. With limited seats to fill, and a consistent incoming flow of individuals being turned over (so that the process can repeat itself), why share or innovate? The term "open-source" is not in the vocabulary. Sharing within the firm is sometimes a no-no, let alone put online for free. *I couldn't help but think this could be done better with software.*

Some examples of solid solutions within the financial industry include:

* **Sell-Side Platforms:** Platforms such as [Axial](http://www.axial.net/axial-homepage/) is an interesting case. Solutions such as this can help with so many repetitive tasks and quality control issues. Further, it allows investment bankers to focus more on advising, and doing what they want to be doing - getting more fees! With that said, other start-ups have tried this in the past. Most notably would be [CapitalIQ](https://www.capitaliq.com) which later successfully pivoted to a data service approach.
* **Buy-Side Strategies:** The advantages of using a computer system to replace humans with investment decisions cannot be denied. We can minimize emotions, backtest, preserve discipline and keep consistency. The idea of scraping the Internet and Bloomberg for data and using AI to predict future values of assets or equity, or determining if a current price is good or bad, is extremely fascinating. This approach seemed like a smarter long-term approach than a traditional path toward Private Equity.
* **Data Management:** Products like [Metropolis](http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/15/who-actually-uses-palantir-finance/#33bb8ead2ae8) have to be the future of the industry. Organizing teams into working together as tribes rather than parallel, like I've seen, has to be so much more efficient. So much of the same work is done over and over in banks right now because of this.

With the amount of waste and its level of importance to the economy, it's hard to believe software can't be written, sold at a profit, while saving companies more than it costs. Whether it be to the company I worked for and others, the financial industry or others -- at a high level, finally having this click in my brain, is why I chose to learn to code immediately. Further, I want to build things, be involved in a better culture, and have a better lifestyle. 

And finally...**Software is eating all of the jobs** AND *I couldn't help but think so much could be done better with software!*
